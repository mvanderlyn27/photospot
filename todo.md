# Code Improvement
- Most important
    - Update/fix server actions for all profile/photospot things
    - add ability to create photospots, and view a map of photospots
    - fix page loading so theres no flash between routing, maybe don't use links, or theres something else needed to not have the nav bar flash between page routes (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55624695/loading-screen-on-next-js-page-transition)

# Bugs 
- create photospot page, reseting the form doesn't clear the file input
- having the watched photos lags the thing out, rn commenting it out 
- updating location on the left bar is kind of broken, text breaks it, and can't enter text over 2 digits
- marker disappears on creation of photospot

# Future Ideas
- realtime for reviews? 
add shadows for photospots, see if you're photospot will be in shadow when you want a shot
- have weather included as well to findout when is the perfect time to take a photo
    - maybe could be the main focus of product to sell to photographers
- have a "placeholder" person to put into a photo for photospots where a user don't want to upload their face, or have a way to blur out the user
- have notification for users how many people liked their photospot they uploaded
- add cool tagging feature for photos
- add cool tagging feature for videos as well
- maybe have whole social media platform, adding friends, messaging, etc
    - need to think through how to make the MVP have most value to users in the beginning
    - setup user feed of photos 
        - show new photos posted at your photospots
        - show new photos posted at tags you like
        - maybe have mapview of your feed, showing hotspots of locations 
- offline
- Could focus in a few areas
    - social media part, finding other photographers near you, seeing their pics, sharing yours
    - planning photography shoots for professionals
    - mainly the "photo trip" planning, focusing on either traveling somewhere, or exploring your own city, multiple locations, focusing more on the photo trip, than just the one location
- Add ability to track when doing a photolist tour, keep track of photos you're trying to take, and whats next, where to go
- focus more on the type of photo you want to take, figure out how to seperate planning taking a specific type of photo, vs going to a photospot

# Intended audiance
- pro photographers?
- amatuer photographers?
- travelers?
- influencers?
