    - look into using sessions to properly avoid this

- some funkiness with moving map around, markers change position on mouse release
- visiting a photospot right after making takes forever
- visiting a photospot for the first time doesn't have the rotate animation

# Future Ideas
- have user enter pos, and direction of shot, and have an AR guide appear for taking new photos, maybe have ar stuff with the sun as well
- extract info from imags with ai/metadata to create tags/ suggestions for users/ guide on how to recreate
- remove background people from photos
- realtime for reviews? 
add shadows for photospots, see if you're photospot will be in shadow when you want a shot
- have weather included as well to findout when is the perfect time to take a photo
    - maybe could be the main focus of product to sell to photographers
- have a "placeholder" person to put into a photo for photospots where a user don't want to upload their face, or have a way to blur out the user
- have notification for users how many people liked their photospot they uploaded
- add cool tagging feature for photos
- add cool tagging feature for videos as well
- maybe have whole social media platform, adding friends, messaging, etc
    - need to think through how to make the MVP have most value to users in the beginning
    - setup user feed of photos 
        - show new photos posted at your photospots
        - show new photos posted at tags you like
        - maybe have mapview of your feed, showing hotspots of locations 
- offline
- Could focus in a few areas
    - social media part, finding other photographers near you, seeing their pics, sharing yours
    - planning photography shoots for professionals
    - mainly the "photo trip" planning, focusing on either traveling somewhere, or exploring your own city, multiple locations, focusing more on the photo trip, than just the one location
- Add ability to track when doing a photolist tour, keep track of photos you're trying to take, and whats next, where to go
- focus more on the type of photo you want to take, figure out how to seperate planning taking a specific type of photo, vs going to a photospot

# Intended audiance
- pro photographers?
- amatuer photographers?
- travelers?
- influencers?
