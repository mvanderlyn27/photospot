- main point
    - don't have a photospot, just have users search locations, and upload inspo photos
    - backend will automatically create a "photospot" based on that location if it doesn't already exist, if it does exist then tie it to the photospot
- Would be good to have photos seperate from photospot 
- maybe make it so you cant name a photospot, just have a location
- creative spot needs to be through the photos you upload there
- new flows
    - user finds cool location
    - takes a picture
    - go to create page
        - find existing photospot, via map/search
        - after location is selected, add photo/details on photo
            - if location right next to another on map (selected via clicking, then warn user that spot already exists)
            - uploads "photoshot" to photospot, tagging location, and explaining how to recreate the shot
            - if location in photospot DB, if so link it to existing photospot else create new entry in db for photospot
    - go to photospot page in saved, or from search
        - click on add photoshot in photobook section
        - add shot in dialog
        - save new photoshot info 
- where photospot info comes from 
    - location saved in photospot
    - golden hour/weather comes from location + api
    - photoshot has photos/tags
        - photoshots can be saved 
    - rating from reviews of photospot
